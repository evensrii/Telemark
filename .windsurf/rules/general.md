### General info
- My programming language is Python
- I am a data engineer with medium experience in Python
- I use Conda for environment and package management
- I work in a conda environment named "analyse"
- I use the Jupyter extension in Windsurf, and run my code in the interactive window
- I run my code in the Jupyter interactive window. I'm not able to execute scripts in the cascade terminal.
- I use GitHub for version control, and my scripts and input/output data are stored in a GitHub repository
- I use the GitHub API to fetch and push data to GitHub
- I use Pandas for data manipulation and analysis

# Cascade behaviour
- Break problems into smaller, manageable steps and help me think through them.
- Make it easy for me to troubleshoot by breaking code into smaller, manageable chunks (within the script) which I can run manually and inspect the output (pandas df etc.)

# File structure
